 **🎯 OPTIMAL CLAUDE CODE PROMPTING STRATEGY**

### **1. Initial Setup Prompt (Copy this exactly):**

```
I'm working on Project Himalaya - Anderson's Library cloud migration. I have a detailed implementation plan in "Project Himalaya - Session Handoff & Next Steps Plan.md" in my project folder.

Please read this plan and help me implement it systematically. We need to:

1. First: Run the round-trip database testing to validate our conversion system
2. Then: Create a minimal MySQL schema for AndyGoogle MVP  
3. Finally: Begin AndyGoogle development with Google Drive integration

I follow Design Standard v2.1 (AIDEV-PascalCase-2.1) - all database elements, file names, and code should use PascalCase naming.

Start by reading the plan document and then ask me which priority you should tackle first. I have MySQL running locally and my AndersonLibrary database ready for testing.
```

### **2. Progressive Implementation Approach:**

**Break it into 3 separate Claude Code sessions:**

#### **Session A: Round-Trip Testing (1-2 hours)**

```
Focus: Complete Priority 1 from the plan - round-trip database testing.

Tasks:
1. Set up the testing environment using the provided scripts
2. Run the round-trip test on my AndersonLibrary database  
3. Analyze results and identify any conversion issues
4. Generate a report with findings and recommendations

Use the SQLiteToMySQLConverter.py and database_testing.sh scripts from the plan.
```

#### **Session B: Minimal Schema (1-2 hours)**

```
Focus: Priority 2 - create minimal MySQL schema for AndyGoogle MVP.

Based on the round-trip testing results, create:
1. Streamlined MySQL schema with only essential tables
2. Migration script from CSV to minimal MySQL
3. Validation that the minimal schema works correctly

Follow the "only include what's needed for next phase" principle from the plan.
```

#### **Session C: AndyGoogle Foundation (2-3 hours)**

```
Focus: Priority 3 - begin AndyGoogle development.

Tasks:
1. Create AndyGoogle project structure
2. Implement Google Drive authentication and basic sync
3. Set up Google Sheets logging functionality
4. Create basic web interface integration

Use the detailed architecture from the plan document.
```

### **3. Context Files to Provide Claude Code:**

**Before each session, ensure these files are in your project:**

- `Project Himalaya - Session Handoff & Next Steps Plan.md` ✅ (you're downloading this)
- `AndersonLibrary_Himalaya_GPU.csv` (your source data)
- Current working SQLite database
- Any existing code from previous web app development

### **4. Effective Follow-up Prompts:**

#### **When Claude Code asks questions:**

```
"Follow the guidance in the plan document. If you need to make a decision, use the most conservative/minimal approach that gets us to a working MVP fastest."
```

#### **When you see issues:**

```
"There's an issue with [specific problem]. Check the 'Potential Challenges & Solutions' section in the plan document - there might be a pre-planned solution."
```

#### **To maintain momentum:**

```
"Great progress! Move on to the next step in the current priority. Keep following the plan systematically."
```

### **5. What Claude Code Excels At (Let it handle):**

✅ **File creation and modification**  
✅ **Running commands and scripts**  
✅ **Code generation following patterns**  
✅ **Testing and validation**  
✅ **Error diagnosis and fixing**  
✅ **Following detailed technical specifications**

### **6. What Needs Your Input (Be ready to help):**

🤔 **Google API credentials and setup**  
🤔 **MySQL password and connection details**  
🤔 **Business logic decisions** (when plan is ambiguous)  
🤔 **Testing validation** (does the result meet your needs?)  
🤔 **Performance tuning** (acceptable speed/behavior?)

### **7. Pro Tips for Best Results:**

#### **Start Each Session With:**

```
"I'm continuing Project Himalaya implementation. Read the plan document and tell me what we accomplished last time, then continue with [specific priority]."
```

#### **When Stuck:**

```
"Check the plan document section [specific section]. The solution should be documented there. If not, use the most minimal approach that works."
```

#### **For Quality Control:**

```
"Before finishing this task, validate it meets the success criteria listed in the plan document for this priority."
```

#### **To Maintain Standards:**

```
"Ensure all code follows Design Standard v2.1 (AIDEV-PascalCase-2.1). All database elements should use PascalCase naming."
```

### **8. Expected Claude Code Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Discovery**

- Reads plan document
- Analyzes current project structure  
- Identifies what needs to be built
- Asks clarifying questions

**Phase 2: Implementation**

- Creates/modifies files systematically
- Runs tests and validates results
- Reports progress and issues
- Follows the plan step-by-step

**Phase 3: Validation**  

- Tests the implementation
- Compares against success criteria
- Reports completion status
- Suggests next steps

### **9. Sample Success Indicators:**

**You'll know it's working well when Claude Code:**

- References the plan document frequently
- Asks specific technical questions (not vague ones)
- Provides progress updates with concrete results
- Identifies and resolves issues systematically
- Suggests logical next steps based on the plan

### **10. Troubleshooting Prompts:**

**If Claude Code seems lost:**

```
"Go back to the plan document. Focus only on [specific priority] and ignore everything else for now. What's the very next action according to the plan?"
```

**If results don't match expectations:**

```
"Check this result against the success criteria in the plan document. Does it meet the requirements? If not, what needs to be adjusted?"
```

## **🚀 RECOMMENDED STARTING COMMAND:**

```bash
# In your project directory with the plan document
claude-code

# Then use the initial setup prompt above
```

**This approach leverages Claude Code's strengths while keeping you in control of the strategic decisions. The detailed plan gives Claude Code excellent context to work autonomously while staying aligned with your vision.**
